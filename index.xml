A network consists of nodes and connections are made through edges where each may have a weight. To each attribute there may also be assigned some attribute. In our case, the network consists of users where each edge signifies an interaction (these are the ones that change between our questions) and are assigned various attributes such as average, price and rating of reviewed wines.</description></item><item><title>Data Preprocessing and Statistics</title><link>https://kaptajnbajer.github.io/CSS_Project_Assignment_B/data-description/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kaptajnbajer.github.io/CSS_Project_Assignment_B/data-description/</guid><description>All the data gathered needs to be processed in order to be useful.

It contains emojies that hold little informative value out of context. The reviews are filtered by the provided language tag from Vivino for only reviews they classify as being in English.</description></item><item><title>What does good wine taste like?</title><link>https://kaptajnbajer.github.io/CSS_Project_Assignment_B/rating/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kaptajnbajer.github.io/CSS_Project_Assignment_B/rating/</guid><description>Under the questionable assumption that the user&amp;rsquo;s average rating reflect that they have reviewed good wines, we will divide it by replacing the previous type with ratings. Vivinos users tend to rate quite high. The 0.25 quantile is at 3.68. If your ratings on average comes to 3.68 25% of Vivinos users would have lower average rating and 75% would have more. These are the bad that drink bad wine. If your average rating is above 4.</description></item><item><title>What does the different wine types taste like?</title><link>https://kaptajnbajer.github.io/CSS_Project_Assignment_B/type/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kaptajnbajer.github.io/CSS_Project_Assignment_B/type/</guid><description>In this network an interaction is defined by if they reviewed the same wine as someone else and the two users share the same preference in wine type.
Red wine drinkers are seen to be the dominant preference. The 5 different preference creates clusters and it would seem the users with multiple preferences have less wines in common on average than the sparkling wine drinkers.
Most interesting statistic is that the maximum amount of degrees (wines in common) a user has falls from 10 000 to 1000 approximately, so the partiotioning drastically reduces the amount of connections.</description></item><item><title>What does wine taste like?</title><link>https://kaptajnbajer.github.io/CSS_Project_Assignment_B/taste/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kaptajnbajer.github.io/CSS_Project_Assignment_B/taste/</guid><description>Examining the general taste of wine we create a network where interactions are simply defined by if users have reviewed the same wine. It looks like this.
Evidently, you are very likely to have reviewed a wine as someone else as shown by the undefinable gray background the edges create.
Infact, this network is so highly interconnected that if you were to pick a user, C, and randomly pick two users whom he individually had a wine review in common with, then there would be a 79.</description></item><item><title>Wine tastes like...</title><link>https://kaptajnbajer.github.io/CSS_Project_Assignment_B/end/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kaptajnbajer.github.io/CSS_Project_Assignment_B/end/</guid><description>One key takeaway from this would be that wine is both good and nice. These are probably the two most dominant words by both the over all occurence (TF) and words the individual user uses (IDF). Perhaps this could also serve to explain the high average rating of 3.91. If you were to treat your guests to some wine, any wine is good wine - atleast the ones sold by Vivino (presumably).</description></item></channel></rss>
