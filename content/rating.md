Under the questionable assumption that the user's average rating reflect that they have reviewed good wines, we will divide it by replacing the previous type with ratings. Vivinos users tend to rate quite high. The 0.25 quantile is at 3.68. If your ratings on average comes to 3.68 25% of Vivinos users would have lower average rating and 75% would have more. These are the bad that drink bad wine. If your average rating is above 4.5 you belong to the top 25% and is an indicator of good wines. Everyone in between these to are average.

Two things are interesting: The many users that have are not connected where it would seem the greens are slightly overrepresented which could be interpretated in many ways. One very cautious guess could be that these have few reviews and only review the truly good wines.

Absolutely nothing of interest happens for user statistics. Amount of degrees also reduces in this network.

I fear that other than poster number 3 (from the top), there is little to go by. Price is apparently a factor by both metrics for the 'perfect' and 'excellent' champagne that obviously has to be furity. I encourage the reader to assess these pictures for themselves and try to estimate the communities average rating.
