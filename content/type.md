In this network an interaction is defined by if they reviewed the same wine as someone else _and_ the two users share the same preference in wine type.

Red wine drinkers are seen to be the dominant preference. The 5 different preference creates clusters and it would seem the users with multiple preferences have less wines in common on average than the sparkling wine drinkers.

Most interesting statistic is that the maximum amount of degrees (wines in common) a user has falls from 10 000 to 1000 approximately, so the partiotioning drastically reduces the amount of connections.

In a exercise of estimation we will have to deduce what the different top communities prefered type is. Luckily, number 2 and 5 of the plots (ordered from the top) both contain red both contain red. A reasonable guess then is that red wine tastes like cherry and sweet. Community at the bottom also seems to concern themselves with the tannins in the wine. Plot number three readily teels that it is champage and that bubbles are central to the experience. An apply, dry, and fresh drink is to prefer. Sadly, it is not entirely possible to discern what the remaining communities prefer.
