All the data gathered needs to be processed in ordet to be useful. Take user "INDSÃ†T NUMMER" review:

$$\text{TEST}$$

Contains emojies that hold little informative value out of context. Furthermore, many reviews are wrongly classified as English. Therefore, reviews containing Cyrilic, Korean, Chinese, or Japanese letters, aswell as the Spanish _and_ ("y") and Danish letters will be removed to focus only on English reviews. 

## Sampling

Unfortunately, there appears to be a thing such as too much data.
