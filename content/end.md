One key takeaway from this would be that wine is both _good_ and _nice_. These are probably the two most dominant words by both the over all occurence (TF) and words the individual user uses (IDF). Perhaps this could also serve to explain the high average rating of 3.91. If you were to treat your guests to some wine,  any wine is good wine - atleast the ones sold by Vivino (presumably). Other than that aim for a dry, fruity with a taste cherry, apples, and citrus preferably stored in an oak barrel. If you wish to buy a red wine consider the tannins. Are sparkling wines/champage more your preference then 

As for the users of Vivinos behaviours the most notable finding is the degree distribution and amount of reviews. Far most users have few reviews with a little group of hyperactive users. Even if you only have one review you are still likely to have an interaction in these networks, which begs the question of if people bought the wine because of the review.

A final remark is that this project has made many mistakes in its making. Everything from basic assumption to methods could have been improved, and most jarringly it seems a far-fetch to consider and treat this a social network. Two users do not have an actual social interactions merely by
