Examining the general taste of wine we create a network where interactions are simply defined by if users have reviewed the same wine. It looks like this.

Evidently, you are very likely to have reviewed a wine as someone else as shown by the undefinable gray background the edges create. 

Infact, this network is so highly interconnected that if you were to pick a user, C, and randomly pick two users whom he individually had a wine review in common with, then there would be a 79.15% chance of those two also having reviewed the same wine. 

With regards to user statistics it is also random as to how the network interacts. However, Vivino's users are more likely to associate with others who have a similar prefered taste.

A general consensus seems to be that wine is good and nice by being dry. The taste is often described by fruity and more specifically it is plubs, cherries, and apples. Also, the mention of oak is presumably that the taste of oak is distinguishable and caused by the storage method.
